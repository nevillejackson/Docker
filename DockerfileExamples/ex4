I try to setup a Docker with both entrypoint and cmd.

FROM debian:stretch
RUN apt-get update && \
apt install gnupg ca-certificates -y 
RUN echo "deb http://repo.aptly.info/ squeeze main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/aptly.list
RUN apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 9E3E53F19C7DE460
RUN apt update && apt install aptly -y
ADD aptly.conf /etc/aptly.conf
ADD start.sh .
VOLUME ["/aptly"]
ENTRYPOINT ["/start.sh"]
CMD ["aptly", "api", "serve"]

But entrypoint script is not stopping... The cmd command is not launching



When you use both entrypoint and command, the command section will be appended to entrypoint executable as arguments. Thus in your case:

ENTRYPOINT ["/start.sh"]
CMD ["aptly", "api", "serve"]

Is equivalent to running:

ENTRYPOINT["/start.sh", "aptly", "api", "serve"]
