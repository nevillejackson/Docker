However, this requires that people clone your repository. If you want to make the Dockerfile work anywhere, in any case, you can do it like this.

FROM alpine:3.16.1 AS build

RUN apk add --no-cache \
    make \
    gcc  \
    git  \
    libc-dev && \
    echo "" > /root/.ash_history && \
    rm -fr /tmp/* /var/tmp/* /var/cache/*/*


RUN git clone https://github.com/nevillejackson/Docker.git src/folli && \
    cd src/folli/Folli && \
    make folli && \
    make test && \
    mv folli /folli && \
    chmod +x /folli

FROM alpine:3.16.1

COPY --from=build /folli /folli

ENTRYPOINT [ "/folli" ]
